This directory is dedicated to mouse movements for the RS bot.

The goal is to create a controller that can move the mouse from point A to point B and look human doing it. The way we are going to achieve this is by recording my mouse movements as I play OSRS and then make the cursor follow these paths. This will mean the set of paths is limited, but I will just have to track long enough for it to become useful and non-repetitive (so as not to get caught). This will also mean that I can't count on pixel perfect pressing, which actually can be ok, since that is a surefire sign of a bot.

Tracking is done via recorde_mouse.py.
